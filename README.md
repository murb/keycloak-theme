# KNMI Keycloak Theme

This theme has been developed using Keycloak 3.4.1.

## Installing

When mounting this theme in the themedir make sure the directory name === "`knmi_theme`".

## Modifying the template

Whilst it is a copy of the default Keycloak-theme, most of the templates are inherited from the base template. When upgrading make sure the copied files from base
still match the variables required:

* `/login/*.ftl`
* `messages/*`

### Some remarks

* Translations can be set in the messages directory. Be careful when using UTF-8 characters, use the ascii notation (e.g. `\u00eb` instead of `Ã«`).


## Todo

* Distributable Theme / build script
